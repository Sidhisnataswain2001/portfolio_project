    	<b>Required Skills:</b>for this mini-project, you need basic knowledgeof HTML, CSS and Javascript. If you are a blogger then it's very easy for you.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Bulb On Off javascript is a mini project. Create an HTML page with the help of CSS and Javascrit, when we click to on button then the bulb will be on and when we click on button off then the bulb will be off. We can design and implement the mini-project with the help of the javascript code
    </p>
    <p><b><i><u>Creation Bulb On Off Jvascript</u></i></b><br><br>

    First, create a folder and create a new file in html, for this small mini level project we just need only one html file with .html extenxion, and download the bulb on off images.</p>

    <p>To turn the bulb on or off, first we need to create an html page with css and apply the javascript code to change the bulb images. We have two images bulb on and bulb off, initially, we are keeping bulb status off</p>

    <p>
    	After that using the DOM(document object model)element, we will change the HTML element attributes values, in simple language when user click to the button on then with the help of the javascript we will change the IMG(image)tag SRC(source) with another image, and the same thing we will do with the button off.
