	Abstract—“Jarvis” was main character of Tony’s Stark’s life
assistant in Movies Iron Man. Unlike original comic in which
Jarvis was Stark’s human butler, the movie version of Jarvis
is an intelligent computer that converses with stark, monitors
his household and help to build and program his superhero
suit.

In this Project Jarvis is Digital Life Assistant which uses
mainly human communication means such Twitter, instant
message and voice to create two way connections between
human and his apartment, controlling lights and appliances,
assist in cooking, notify him of breaking news, Facebook’s
Notifications and many more. In our project we mainly
use voice as communication means so the Jarvis is basically the
Speech recognition application. The concept of speech
technology really encompasses two technologies: Synthesizer
and recognizer. A speech synthesizer takes as input and
produces an audio stream as output. A speech recognizer
on the other hand does opposite. It takes an audio stream as
input and thus turns it into text transcription. The voice is
a signal of infinite information. A direct analysisand
synthesizing the complex voice signal is due to too much
information contained in the signal. Therefore the digital
signal processes such as Feature Extraction and Feature
Matching are introduced to represent the voice signal. In
this project we directly use speech engine which use Feature
extraction technique as Mel scaled frequency cepstral. The melscaled frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) derived from
Fourier transform and filter bank analysis are perhaps the
most widely used front- ends in state-of-the-art speech
recognition systems. Our aim to create more and more
functionalities which can help human to assist in their daily
life and also reduces their efforts. In our test we check all
this functionality is working properly. We test this on 2
speakers(1 Female and 1 Male) for accuracy purpose.
