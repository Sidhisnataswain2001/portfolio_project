				Looking back, the 90s sounds so obsolete now. Well, it has been two decades since then and it has become a sort of peaceful memory we keep in our treasure chests. It’s just there in sepia colors waiting for us to recall a Saturday filled with cartoons on our chunky TV monitor, an afternoon spent just talking to our best friends on our wired telephones until it’s time for dinner, and random days with our friends outside, just laughing and goofing around. It was very subtle and sweet. There are days when we just stare at our computers wondering what else this machine can do. Is there more to it than just typing our school papers here? Why can’t we use our telephones while we are searching the web? It was the transition period to the modern world where the internet is accessible to almost everyone on the planet. It does not seem as momentous as the times before and after the 90s, but it actually was.<br><br>

A lot of things happened in this notable era that shaped the world where we are today. Look around you and see how everything is within your reach. Everything is just a click away! Do you need to book a hotel? Do you want a dinner reservation for two? Do you wish to pay your employees without sending a check? Everything is online and the possibilities are endless. One of the many exciting things we can do now is Ecommerce.<br><br></p>

<p><b><i><u>What is ecommerce website?</u></i></b><br><p>
Ecommerce or electronic commerce refers to a business model that involves sales transactions being done on the web. Virtually every online shopping website - big or small - follows this structure. Any site where you can obtain items for sale over the internet is considered an ecommerce website.<br><br>

Ebay and Amazon, the grandfathers of ecommerce, paved the way to a newer and more convenient way of shopping. They are actually not that old to be called grandfathers, but the higher level of respect is implied there. Of course online buying and selling were already a thing before, but because of these companies, e-commerce website became an easier and more preferred platform to a lot of consumers.<br><br>

People were very skeptical to use these sites to purchase their items there because they are prone to fraudulent activities and scamming schemes. It is still evident up to this day, but developers come up with solutions to better people’s shopping experience. Examples of these solutions are reviews, return policy, and cash on delivery. These features help consumers decide if they should purchase items from an e-commerce website or not.<br><br>

One of the obvious differences between an ecommerce website and an ordinary business or company website is in the features that it supports. A company website may just house information on the brand’s product and services so users will need to contact the company directly if they want to do business with them. Meanwhile, an ecommerce website works pretty much like how a physical store works. Users can purchase items, arrange for delivery and payments on the same site without the need to call a human person to help them with their order. When you start learning how to create ecommerce website content, you’ll find that it’s a bit more complicated to put up an online store compared to an ordinary website because of the features and design elements that the former requires.<br><br>

There are a lot of ecommerce websites selling a variety of items now. From clothing pieces to food items to gardening materials, one must be creative to make his or her brand more unique than the other. Even social media accounts are becoming ecommerce platforms and are developed to be ecommerce websites nowadays. The only difference is that on an e-commerce website, you don’t have to deal with a human to be able to buy and get your items delivered to your doorstep. An ecommerce website must be as functional as it is with or without the owners or managers monitoring the site and dealing with their customers every second of the day.
